Handlebars defaults to escaping, which I think is correct as it is erring on the safe side. If you want to escape content in a handler, it is in the documented.

Use "Handlebars.Utils.escapeExpression" to escape content and Handlebars.SafeString to avoid the return value from being escaped.

Example:

var str = "<div>This content is safe. <span>";
var unsafeContentFromUser = ...;
str += Handlebars.Utils.escapeExpression(unsafeContentFromUser);
str += "</span>. This Content is also safe</div>";

return new Handlebars.SafeString(str);
As shown here, the content is a mix of safe and unsafe content. The unsafe content is manually escaped and then a safe string is returned to prevent the default behavior of escaping the return value.
