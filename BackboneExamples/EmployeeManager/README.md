###Backbone JS Employee Manager Application
This is a very simple implementation of BackboneJS. A simple Employee Manager Demo Application with the following features

##### 1. Adding a new employee
##### 2. Removing an existing employee
##### 3. Editing an Employee Name
##### 4. Employee List

The application follows the MV* pattern wherein it has model, collection and views. This was developed as part of a Backbone training I gave.
This demo application does not have any REST API support. I am using pre-defined JSON data which is bundled along with the package.
